title: About
---

I'm a PhD student in mathematics at the Technical University of Dresden,
Germany.  In my copious free time[^1] I like to hack on [free
software]—especially anything involving [Haskell] or [Emacs]—play the
guitar, ride my bike around, or watch classic movies.  I also spend way
too much money on (good) coffee and tea.

My work in mathematics can broadly be characterised under the term
"category theory".  In particular, I like thinking about things like
[Hopf monads], [graphical calculi], [duoidal] and [linearly
distributive] categories, as well as [operads].  If you're interested in
my publications, you can check out my name on the [arXiv].  I've also
given some talks, slides of which are available [here](./research.html).
