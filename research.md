Most of my work is in applied category theory, where I study e.g. how
algebraic notions lift into a more categorical framework and how much of
the theory still works in that context.

- *Pivotality, twisted centres and the anti-double of a Hopf monad.* \
  Joint work with Sebastian Halbig; [arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05361).

  Finite-dimensional Hopf algebras admit a correspondence between
  so-called pairs in involution, one-dimensional anti-Yetter–Drinfeld
  modules and algebra isomorphisms between the Drinfeld and
  anti-Drinfeld double.  We extend it to general rigid monoidal
  categories and provide a monadic interpretation under the assumption
  that certain coends exist.  Hereto we construct and study the
  anti-Drinfeld double of a Hopf monad.  As an application the
  connection with the pivotality of Drinfeld centres and their
  underlying categories is discussed.

## Talks

- *Pivotality, twisted centres and the anti-double of a Hopf monad* \
  Based on [joint work with Sebastian Halbig](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05361).

  Pairs in involution are an algebraic structure whose systematic study
  is motivated by their applications in knot theory, representation
  theory and cyclic homology theories.  We will explore a categorical
  version of these objects from the perspective of representation theory
  of monoidal categories.  A focus will lie on illustrating how their
  existence is linked to a particular well-behaved notion of duality,
  called pivotality.  As a central point, we show how the language of
  monads allows us to combine the algebraic and categorical perspective
  on such pairs.

- *Optics in functional programming—a categorical perspective* \
  TU Dresden, 2022-01-10; [slides](/talks/profunctor-optics.pdf).

  A talk about the categorical aspects of (profunctor) optics, as done
  by [Riley] and [Clark et.al.], as well as connections to earlier
  mathematical work by [Pastro and Street].

- *Visual Category Theory* \
  TU Dresden, 2021-07-26.

  The defense of my master's thesis, concentrating on a
  higher-dimensional graphical calculus, as first introduced by
  [Willerton] and extended in the thesis.  The "basic" [slides] are
  available—the talk was given on a Wacom tablet and thus contained many
  live drawings to illustrate the concepts.  These, however, are lost to
  time.

## Theses

- *Comodules for Categories*

  Master's thesis; with the help of a higher-dimensional graphical
  calculus, the Hopf algebraic anti-Drinfeld centre is lifted into the
  language of comodule monads.  An interesting equivalence relating the
  (anti-)Drinfeld centre and (anti-)Yetter--Drinfeld modules is proven
  in this monadically enriched setting.

- *From Knot Theory to Algebra*

  Bachelor's thesis with a focus on keis; objects arising naturally when
  trying to generalize the number of 3-colourings of a knot.
