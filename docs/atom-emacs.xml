<p></p>
In a <a href="/posts/orgmode-prompt/2022-08-27-xmonad-and-org-mode.html">previous post</a> I talked about
<a href="https://xmonad.github.io/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Prompt-OrgMode.html">XMonad.Prompt.OrgMode</a>, an <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad module to rapidly capture thoughts
and ideas into an Org file. The functionality that the module provides
has proven to be extremely useful to me, and really I couldn’t be
happier with it. However, a user recently contacted me by email and
told me that they’re missing but one feature: the ability to immediately
refile notes.
<!--more-->
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p></p>
If you don’t know, <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Refile-and-Copy.html">refiling</a> is the act of moving an entry<!--
--><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">A headline, possibly with an attached body.</span></span>
 <em>below</em>
another heading; i.e., such that it becomes a subheading there. This
can be useful for structuring <span class="small-caps">todo</span>s into separate categories: one might
have projects called “work”, “life”, “<span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad”, and so on, where all
related tasks live. Quite convenient!
<p></p>
So far, X.P.OrgMode just dumped the created note at the end of the
specified file, leaving you to pick up the pieces. This aligns with my
personal workflow—while I extensively use refiling, I only do so at the
end of the day after reviewing all tasks that have accumulated.
However, it is conceivable that someone might want to refile certain
tasks straight away when it’s pretty clear that (i) they’ll be kept, and
(ii) they can be unambiguously assigned to a certain heading (e.g., an
already scheduled work meeting with X).
<h2 id="showcase">Showcase</h2>
<p></p>
Long story short, this is now built into X.P.OrgMode. There are two new
functions:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">    </span><span class="n">orgPromptRefile</span><span class="w">   </span><span class="ow">::</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">XPConfig</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">-&gt;</span><span class="w">           </span><span class="kt">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">FilePath</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">X</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">()</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">orgPromptRefileTo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">::</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">XPConfig</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">FilePath</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">X</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">()</span>
</pre></div>

<p></p>
The former takes the same arguments as <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.17.1/docs/XMonad-Prompt-OrgMode.html#v:orgPrompt">orgPrompt</a> (which see), and is
for popping up another prompt that asks for a heading. The latter
refiles everything under the specified (as the second argument) heading.
<p></p>
The way <code>orgPromptRefile</code> works is that, after querying for a <span class="small-caps">todo</span>, it
<em>always</em> inserts the note into the file and then <em>possibly</em> refiles it
to another heading. This way, you don’t need to worry about losing
notes when you abort the refiling prompt or enter a non-existent
heading.
<p></p>
<img class="pure-img" src="../images/orgmode-refiling/refiling.gif">
<p></p>
Note: Refiling is (near) instant; the delay you are seeing above is due
to <code>auto-revert-mode</code>.
<h3 id="some-gory-details">Some gory details</h3>
<p></p>
All of the refiling is actually directly done by Emacs itself! More
precisely, the <span class="small-caps">edsl</span> that <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib/docs/XMonad-Util-Run.html">XMonad.Util.Run</a> defines—which I’ve also
<a href="/posts/2022-05-25-calling-emacs-from-xmonad.html">written about</a>—shells out to Emacs. This
might intuitively <em>feel</em> horrible, but that’s just another reason to
share it:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">refile</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">::</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">FilePath</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">X</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">()</span>

<span class="w">                            </span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">saveExcursion</span>
<span class="w">                               </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&quot;org-find-exact-headline-in-buffer&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">parent</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="w">                            </span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="w">                </span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;save-buffer&quot;</span>
<span class="w">                </span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre></div>

<p></p>
This—as you probably guessed already—just executes the following elisp
snippet in Emacs’s batch mode:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">progn</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">find-file</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">«</span><span class="nv">fp</span><span class="err">»</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">end-of-buffer</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">org-refile</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">nil</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">nil</span>
<span class="w">              </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">list</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">«</span><span class="nv">parent</span><span class="err">»</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">«</span><span class="nv">fp</span><span class="err">»</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">nil</span>
<span class="w">                    </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">save-excursion</span>
<span class="w">                      </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">org-find-exact-headline-in-buffer</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">«</span><span class="nv">parent</span><span class="err">»</span><span class="p">))))</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">save-buffer</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p></p>
I know this seems insane, but letting Emacs do this work is actually
much less brittle than the alternative. The Org maintainers certainly
know best what refiling <em>means</em>, and thus also what it entails—if all of
this logic is already written, why not take advantage of it? Plus, I
now don’t have to keep track of subtle changes in newer versions of Org.
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p></p>
Writing this was actually a lot of fun, and a great opportunity to play
with the <span class="small-caps">edsl</span> that X.U.Run exposes. I reckon there are a few places in
my own <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad configuration in which I could use these kinds of “Emacs
scripts” to great effect!
<p></p>
One other idea I’ve had is to integrate this into the language that
plain old <code>orgPrompt</code> accepts. It could be prefixed by something like
“<code>ref:</code>”, followed by a unique substring with which to identity a
heading. This would have the disadvantage that—without the second
prompt—one would not get any suggestions for headings. However, if you
want to refile something you probably know where you want to put it;
plus, it would not involve a possibly distracting second prompt.
Actually, this sounds like a good first pull request: contributions
welcome!

<p></p>
I’d like to announce a small package I’ve written: <a href="https://github.com/slotThe/vc-use-package">vc-use-package</a>. It
is a first attempt at integrating the new (as of Emacs 29)
<code>package-vc.el</code> with the now built-in use-package. I’ve already talked
about how these two interact in my <a href="https://tony-zorman.com/posts/2022-11-30-package-vc-install.html">last post</a>—you can
see this package as automating things juuuust a little more.
<!--more-->
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p></p>
For the last post, someone gave me some <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/z9i4ce/exploring_packagevcinstall_as_an_alternative_to/iygzeum/">feedback</a>:
couldn’t we go a little further? In particular, they wanted a new <code>:vc</code>
keyword for use-package, much like <a href="https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa">quelpa</a> has done with
<a href="https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package">quelpa-use-package</a>. I already gave them a small working example in a
follow-up comment, but figured this might actually interest enough
people so that turning it into a proper package could be worth it; and
here we are!
<p></p>
The basic premise is really this simple—we create a handler for a new
<code>:vc</code> use-package keyword. It can be used like so:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">use-package</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">math-delimiters</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nb">:vc</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">:fetcher</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">github</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">:repo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">oantolin/math-delimiters</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p></p>
One can specify most arguments that <code>package-vc-install</code> also accepts; for example:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">use-package</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">math-delimiters</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nb">:vc</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">:fetcher</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;github&quot;</span>
<span class="w">       </span><span class="nb">:repo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;oantolin/math-delimiters&quot;</span>
<span class="w">       </span><span class="nb">:rev</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;master&quot;</span><span class="w">         </span><span class="c1">; also accepts the special `:last-release'</span>
<span class="w">       </span><span class="nb">:backend</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Git</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p></p>
Much like quelpa-use-package, there is some care needed concerning the
interaction between this package and the <code>use-package-always-ensure</code>
variable, but this should mostly be taken care of automatically. For
more information (and manual controls), see the
<a href="https://github.com/slotThe/vc-use-package#in-combination-with-use-package-always-ensure">README</a>.
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p></p>
As I’ve said in the corresponding Reddit post, now that both
<code>package-vc.el</code> and use-package are built-in, someone should really add
this to Emacs proper. Alas, since I copied the idea and most of the
initial implementation from quelpa-use-package—and thus copyright
assignment is a bit iffy—it will not be me. Still, implementing this
from scratch does not sound so hard. If anyone feels inspired to do
exactly this, I’d be delighted!

<p></p>
The Emacs 29 release branch was just cut—and it’s chock full of new
features! In this post, I want to talk about the new
<code>package-vc-install</code> function, which allows one to install packages
directly from their respective upstream source; for example, GitHub. It
can be seen as a built-in alternative to things like quelpa or
straight.el.
<!--more-->
<h2 id="the-story-so-far">The story so far</h2>
<p></p>
I’ve been using <a href="https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa">quelpa</a> and <a href="https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package">quelpa-use-package</a> to install packages
that are not on any popular archive straight from source. Especially
the latter package resulted in an almost seemless integration with the
rest of my configuration; for example:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">use-package</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">math-delimiters</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nb">:quelpa</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">math-delimiters</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">:fetcher</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">github</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">:repo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;oantolin/math-delimiters&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p></p>
<a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=5fa2f116799b8a7c17ff6eedd6e1b1af077c116b">Recently</a>, Emacs added built-in capabilities for
installing a package directly from its remote repository. Eager to
shave yet another external package from my otherwise ever growing list,
I took <code>package-vc.el</code> out for a spin: turns out, it almost perfectly
covers the use-case for which I—and perhaps a few other people—used
quelpa up until now!
<p></p>
The most user-facing of these new functions is <code>package-vc-install</code>,
with signature
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">package-vc-install</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">PACKAGE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kp">&amp;optional</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">NAME</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">REV</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">BACKEND</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p></p>
In the simplest case, it takes a URL pointing to some online source as
its argument and installs the respective package from there, guessing
the name from the URL. In case that doesn’t work—or one wants more
control, like requiring a specific revision—there are some other
optional arguments available, see the function’s documentation.
<h2 id="customising-package-vc-install">Customising <code>package-vc-install</code></h2>
<p></p>
When a package is already installed, <code>package-vc-install</code> will ask the
user to interactively confirm whether they really want to overwrite the
existing directory. Naturally, this is not a good experience when
trying to use this in a non-interactive fashion.
<p></p>
There are a few ways one could go about fixing this. One of these is
even documented in the manual: customise <code>package-vc-selected-packages</code>
and then call <code>package-vc-install-selected-packages</code>, which works much
like <code>package-install-selected-packages</code>. However, this feels
unergonomic to me—at least considering that I want to use
<code>package-vc-install</code> as a (hopefully) drop-in replacement for
use-package’s <code>quelpa</code> keyword. Plus, I’d rather have the information
that package X is not installed from *<span class="small-caps">elpa</span> local to the use-package
declaration of X itself.
<p></p>
So, let’s take the easy way out and write a small wrapper:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">cl-defun</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">slot/vc-install</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kp">&amp;key</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">fetcher</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;github&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">repo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">rev</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">backend</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="s">&quot;Install a package from a remote if it's not already installed.</span>
<span class="s">This is a thin wrapper around </span><span class="ss">`package-vc-install'</span><span class="s"> in order to</span>

In case you think I cherry picked the example, <a href="https://gitlab.com/slotThe/dotfiles/-/commit/6d55ac184af125a117215a1bb812ad75c5b0ab03">here</a>
is the full commit that exchanges quelpa for <code>slot/vc-install</code>.

<p></p>
Admittedly, my use of quelpa was rather primitive. I can imagine users
more heavily invested in, for example, the <code>straight.el</code> ecosystem
probably want a bit more out of their package manager than <code>package.el</code>
can give them right now, even with the added convenience of
<code>package-vc.el</code>. However, for me—and probably at least a few people out
there—this is quite enough. After all, for anything more there’s always

Here’s a fun one: when previewing LaTeX fragments via AUCTeX’s
<code>preview.el</code> library (whether it be in a .tex buffer, or—via
<a href="https://github.com/karthink/org-auctex">org-auctex</a>—in Org) things get <em>really</em> messed up when one or more
monitors are set up in portrait mode.
<!--more-->
<p></p>
When you have two monitors oriented vertically, previews might end up
looking something like this:
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img class="pure-img" src="../images/vertical-preview/two-vertical.png">
</p>
<p></p>
With the perhaps more common setup of one vertical and one horizontal
monitor, you could instead get the charming
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img class="pure-img" src="../images/vertical-preview/one-vertical.png">
</p>
<p></p>
Imagine a whole page of this—things get pretty funky. Being a boring
person, I would rather prefer the much more ordinary looking
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img class="pure-img" src="../images/vertical-preview/normal.png">
</p>
<p></p>
Thankfully, this isn’t so complicated. Looking into <code>preview.el</code>, we
get the geometry of the frame from <code>preview-get-geometry</code>. At least,
this is what <code>preview-generate-preview</code> calls before delegating the
heavy lifting to some internal functions. After staring at the former
function for a while, one can single out <code>preview-get-dpi</code> as the main
culprit. It seems to calculate the “resolution” of the preview:

<p></p>
Monitor details are returned by the <code>frame-monitor-attributes</code> function;
its output for a horizontal monitor is

</pre></div>

<p></p>
While the same monitor in “vertical-mode” returns
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">  </span><span class="o">'</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">.</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;DP1&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre></div>

<p></p>
Crucially, the physical width and height of the monitor don’t change,
but the <em>geometry</em>—the pixel width and height—does; you can <code>C-h f display-monitor-attributes-list RET</code> for more information. This means
that in portrait mode, we actually compare the pixel <em>width</em> of the
monitor with its physical <em>height</em>, as well as its pixel height with its
width. Naturally, and depending on the specific setup, this produces
too narrow or too wide previews.
<p></p>
The solution is to only compare the comparable values. Indeed,
overriding the built-in <code>preview-get-dpi</code> function with
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">preview-get-dpi</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">()</span>

<p></p>
produces the correct behaviour! This implicit assumption—that monitors
are generally wider than they are tall—of <code>preview-get-dpi</code> should
probably be fixed; I will report it as an Emacs bug.
<p></p>
As an aside, this is an excellent opportunity to see the ergonomic
benefits of the <a href="https://github.com/magnars/dash.el">dash.el</a> library. Compare the readability of the
“fixed” implementation using <code>-let</code> to the original one above. I
certainly know which of the two I’d rather write!

Emacs is the “extensible text editor”, and it wouldn’t be fun if one
didn’t at least try to take advantage of that, right? Having just
written a <a href="https://gitlab.com/slotThe/dotfiles/-/tree/master/emacs/.config/emacs">README</a> for my Emacs configuration, I
thought it might be nice to somewhat expand on certain ideas and give a
little context to some snippets that have accumulated over time.
<p></p>
While there is a post about <a href="https://tony-zorman.com/posts/query-replace/2022-08-06-query-replace-many.html">my version</a> of the
<code>query-replace</code> function, most other tidbits have only seen the light of
day in places like the “Weekly Tips, Tricks, &c.” thread on Reddit. In
the spirit of hosting my content somewhere that I actually control,<!--
--><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I am aware of the futility of this—Reddit is almost certainly
going to be around longer than my personal site will. And yet,
this feels “more correct” in some way.</span></span>

I chose to showcase these again here, hoping that other people may also
find some of this stuff useful.
<!--more-->
<h2 id="frame-inhibit-implied-resize"><code>frame-inhibit-implied-resize</code></h2>
<p></p>
This variable is interesting for all the people who, for one reason or
another, care about the startup time of their Emacs session. Even more
if one uses a tiling window manager, as then Emacs doesn’t get a say in
how big its frame will be anyway. An excerpt from the documentation:
<blockquote>
<p></p>
Whether frames should be resized implicitly.
<p></p>
If this option is nil, setting font, menu bar, tool bar, tab bar,
internal borders, fringes or scroll bars of a specific frame may
resize the frame in order to preserve the number of columns or lines
it displays. If this option is t, no such resizing is done.
</blockquote>
<p></p>
I always wondered why startup time skyrocketed whenever I changed the
default font to something else—surely opening a font and using it can’t
be that expensive! What I didn’t realise was that what I set was
slightly larger than Emacs’s default font, which I reckon was some kind
of monospace fallback on my system. Setting
<code>frame-inhibit-implied-resize</code> to <code>t</code> will thusly prevent Emacs from
trying to—futilely, since I use <a href="https://xmonad.org"><span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad</a>—resize its frame in order to
“preserve the number of columns or lines it displays”. The upshot is
that this cuts my startup time from just over 1 second to about 0.8
seconds. This may not seem like much, but it’s literally <a href="https://gitlab.com/slotThe/dotfiles/-/blob/460060b7b5e164e6b892397e264b0da470ed74c9/emacs/.config/emacs/early-init.el#L51">setting a
single variable</a> in my <code>early-init.el</code>—pretty good
value for money.
<h2 id="pixel-scroll-precision-mode"><code>pixel-scroll-precision-mode</code></h2>
<p></p>
This is pretty old news by now, but I wanted to take the opportunity to
again praise <code>pixel-scroll-precision-mode</code>. My day job is being a <a href="./phd-workflow/2022-05-01-my-phd-workflow.html">PhD
student in maths</a>, which means that I write a lot of
LaTeX and also use Org extensively for taking notes. While ordinary
LaTeX entry in Org works quite well, commutative diagrams are a pain
more often than not. In fact, It’s much easier to draw them with a tool
like <a href="https://q.uiver.app/">quiver</a>, make a screenshot, and then include the resulting picture
in the file. However, now we have the problem that Emacs treats
pictures as very large single characters—the result is a scrolling
experience that’s very far from optimal. This is <em>exactly</em> where
<code>pixel-scroll-precision-mode</code> comes in and saves the day, but see the
difference for yourself:

<h2 id="quickly-insert-images-in-org-roam">Quickly insert images in <code>org-roam</code></h2>
<p></p>
Speaking of inserting images into Org; how does one do that, exactly?
Doing everything by hand seems like a slog: select an arbitrary
rectangle on the screen, take a screenshot of it, move the resulting
picture into the correct directory, give it an appropriate name, and
insert a link to it into the current buffer. This sounds like a lot of
busywork for something that I ideally don’t want to think about at all;
thankfully, most of this can be nicely automated.

All it needs is <code>xdotool</code> for moving the mouse (though, if you don’t use
<code>unclutter</code> then this may well be deleted) and <code>scrot</code> for actually
taking the screenshot. Pretty convenient. If <code>scrot</code> is too low-tech
for you, then the above snippet probably also works with <code>flameshot</code> or
a similar tool.

I am pretty impatient when it comes to LaTeX entry. So impatient that I
have created a few “now you’re really taking it too far”-type of
functions. To be honest, they kind of delight me.
<p></p>
First, the following is an override for the <code>self-insert-command</code>, which
enables faster entry of one-character math symbols:

<p></p>
Bound to <code>&lt;SPC&gt;</code> (and also things like <code>.</code> and <code>-</code>), it enables one to
write <code>"foo T&lt;SPC&gt;"</code> and have Emacs insert <code>"foo $T$ "</code> instead—very
convenient, and much faster even than having a snippet to insert dollars
based on some condition.
<p></p>
The laziness continues with me not wanting to write <code>\blank</code> so
often.<!--
--><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This is a placeholder that’s often used when not wanting to
explicitly quantify over an argument.</span></span>
 I could also create an auto-expanding snippet for this, but
wouldn’t it be <em>much better</em> to insert it on a double tap of the space
bar instead? I think so!
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">slot/LaTeX-space</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kp">&amp;optional</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">arg</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre></div>

<p></p>
Now, writing something like <code>"C(&lt;SPC&gt;&lt;SPC&gt;,&lt;SPC&gt;&lt;SPC&gt;)"</code> in math-mode
nicely inserts <code>"C( \blank , \blank )"</code>. Because the space bar is so
easy to press, this is again marginally faster than having to write
something like <code>"C(bln,bln)"</code>.
<p></p>
Together with auto-expanding snippets, this enables reasonably fast
LaTeX entry:

<h2 id="erc">ERC</h2>
<p></p>
I recently switched from WeeChat to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/erc.html">ERC</a> for IRC. It’s
really great so far, but some things felt a bit lackluster out of the
box. As such, my <a href="https://gitlab.com/slotThe/dotfiles/-/blob/460060b7b5e164e6b892397e264b0da470ed74c9/emacs/.config/emacs/lisp/erc-config.el">ERC config</a> has already grown quite a
bit.<!--

 The following are a few tweaks that improve my experience
greatly.
<h3 id="mark-the-current-frame-as-urgent">Mark the current frame as urgent</h3>
<p></p>
One feature I was dearly missing was the ability to set <a href="https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/ICC/client-to-window-manager/wm-hints.html">urgency
hints</a> in the case I get highlighted/pinged. This is
essentially the window telling your window manager or desktop
environment that it wants your attention. You can then execute an
action based on this urgency hint. Thankfully, Emacs is extensible, so
hacking this behaviour into ERC wasn’t actually all that complicated.

<p></p>
And that’s really it! Now ERC correctly sends an urgency hint whenever
I get highlighted. Note that, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/xjyuni/weekly_tips_tricks_c_thread/ipfjlw0/">as we found out</a>, if
you use a reparenting window manager (you probably do if you use a
desktop environment) you might have to give <code>x-change-window-property</code>
above an extra <code>t</code> argument.
<h3 id="dont-highlight-quite-so-much">Don’t highlight quite so much</h3>
<p></p>
Having configured quite a few regular expressions for when I get
highlighted, things can get quite overwhelming at times. For example,
when ERC starts up it prints <code>/users</code> in every channel buffer. Of
course, I’m a user in a channel that I’m in, so Emacs happily starts
beeping and throwing around urgency hints—not a good experience. This
also clutters the <code>ERC Keywords</code> buffer (which is built-in and akin to
WeeChat’s <code>highmon.pl</code>).
<p></p>
Thankfully, however, there is a straightforward hack around this: just
check the message for certain regular expression first and do nothing
when they are present.

Next to being a user, I also spend way too much time working on <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad.
As such, I often help people coming into our IRC or posting on the

I bind this to <code>C-c l</code> in <code>markdown-mode</code>; it looks like this:

<img class="pure-img" src="../images/emacs-potpourri/markdown-entry.gif">
<h2 id="a-macro-for-repeat-mode">A macro for <code>repeat-mode</code></h2>
<p></p>
I’ve written a macro for Emacs’s <code>repeat-mode</code>, which allows you to
execute repeated commands without having to press the same prefix over
and over again. For example, one can set this up for Org navigation
commands such that <code>C-c C-n n n</code> executes <code>org-next-visible-heading</code>
three times. A great introduction to <code>repeat-mode</code> can be found
<a href="https://karthinks.com/software/it-bears-repeating/">here</a>.
<p></p>
There are <a href="https://tildegit.org/acdw/define-repeat-map.el">lots</a> of <a href="https://github.com/mmarshall540/repeaters">packages</a>
around that define different macros which probably work much better than
the one below. Even <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package">use-package</a> now sports a <code>:repeat-map</code> keyword
now. However, obviously the one I wrote feels the most natural to <em>me</em>,
so it’s being kept around regardless.

This may be too implicit for many people, but for me it’s just right—and
that’s sort of the point of all of this, right?

<p></p>
As I’ve said before, basically my entire digital life happens in either
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> or <a href="https://xmonad.org/"><span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad</a>. Thus, a lot of time spent on my setup either goes
towards working on the two configurations separately, or—as we’ll do
today—bringing them ever closed together.
<p></p>
Specifically, I want to showcase a new<!--
--><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">In version <code>0.17.0</code>, though new features are coming for <code>0.17.1</code>,
which will drop soon!</span></span>
 <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad module:
<a href="https://xmonad.github.io/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Prompt-OrgMode.html">XMonad.Prompt.OrgMode</a>. Building on top of <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad’s prompt—which works
much like <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">dmenu</a>—it is designed to rapidly capture thoughts and ideas
whenever inspiration strikes and, importantly, to do so without
disrupting one’s current workflow. The module recently got support for
Org <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Priorities.html">priorities</a>, so I figured this was as good an excuse as
any to talk about it.
<!--more-->
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p></p>
One theme in the post about my <a href="../phd-workflow/2022-05-01-my-phd-workflow.html">research workflow</a> was how it’s possible
to use org-mode (with all of its appendages, like <a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">org-roam</a>) to
organise one’s thoughts. <code>XMonad.Prompt.OrgMode</code> was created as yet
another link in that chain. Unlike when writing tiny <a href="../2022-05-25-calling-emacs-from-xmonad.html">Emacs Lisp
scripts in <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad</a>, this does not involve any
custom elisp code one has to run; all of it is taken care of by the
module itself.
<p></p>
The upshot of all of this is a tool to quickly and unobtrusively jot
down an idea—quiet the monkey mind—and then get back to work straight
away. For me, having something like this is very important, lest I get
distracted by some thought about another project and spend the next hour
or so working on that instead of doing what I was actually supposed to
do. Having the idea written down in a known place—perhaps even with an
automatic reminder in my <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Views.html">agenda</a>—helps me get rid of that creeping
anxiety that I’m forgetting things left and right.
<h3 id="functionality">Functionality</h3>
<p></p>
The following showcases the core functionality of the module—taking
notes!
<p></p>
<img class="pure-img" src="./simple-task.gif">
<p></p>
In case you <em>really</em> don’t want to forget something, there is also the
ability to create <code>DEADLINE</code> and <code>SCHEDULED</code> tasks. Optionally, you can
also specify a <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Priorities.html">priority</a>, depending on the importance of the note. If
you add the org file in which the <span class="small-caps">todo</span>s are placed to the
<code>org-agenda-files</code> variable, then this will immediately show these tasks
in your agenda!
<p></p>
<img class="pure-img" src="./deadline-task.gif">
<p></p>
How exactly one may specify the <code>SCHEDULED</code> and <code>DEADLINE</code> keywords, as
well as a date, time, and priority is covered in detail in the
<a href="https://xmonad.github.io/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Prompt-OrgMode.html">documentation</a> for <code>X.P.OrgMode</code>.
<p></p>
Last but not least, it’s possible to capture the current (primary)
selection and, depending on the type of thing in it, use that as either

it will be of the form <code>[[link][input-text]]</code>); if not, just add the
selection to the body of the note.

To round things off—and quickly showcase another cool (and new!)
module, <a href="https://xmonad.github.io/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Actions-Prefix.html">XMonad.Actions.Prefix</a>—here is a sample keybinding that takes
“normal” <code>TODO</code> notes on <code>M-o c</code><!--
--><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Note that for this post, <code>M</code> means <code>&lt;Super_L&gt;</code> and not <code>&lt;Alt_L&gt;</code>.</span></span>
 and uses the selection when called
with a universal argument:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">-- uses {-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase #-}</span>
<span class="nf">orgKey</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">::</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">String</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">X</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">()</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre></div>

<p></p>
I’ve found <code>M-u</code> to be quite convenient for <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad’s universal argument
key, mirroring the <code>C-u</code> convention from Emacs. In either case, simply
add the <code>usePrefixArgument</code> combinator somewhere to your <code>main</code> function
and give it your preferred keybinding. For example:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">main</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">::</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">IO</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">()</span>
<span class="nf">main</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">xmonad</span>
<span class="w">     </span><span class="o">.</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">usePrefixArgument</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;M-u&quot;</span>
<span class="w">     </span><span class="o">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">def</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">modMask</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">mod4Mask</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="c1">-- use &lt;Super&gt; as mod</span>
<span class="w">          </span><span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p></p>
If you’re anything like me, this will soon become an integral part of
your workflow and you won’t want to live without it. If not, then
perhaps you still don’t understand what all the fuss is about; in either
case, I’d like to <a href="mailto:soliditsallgood@mailbox.org">hear from you</a>!

As its name suggests, Emacs’s <code>query-replace</code> function (bound to <code>M-%</code>
by default) can be used to replace occurences of one string with
another. In comparison to other tools that are used for similar
purposes—(a subset of) keyboard macros and multiple-cursors—the whole
process after entering the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> strings is interactive all
the way through: it’s very fast to step through the individual matches
and decide on the spot whether one would like to replace them or not.
Needless to say, I like <code>query-replace</code> a lot! In true Emacs fashion,
the function also takes way too many arguments: among other things, it
can operate on the current region, backwards, or only on things
surrounded by words boundaries.
<p></p>
However, there is one crucial feature missing from its default
functionality: the ability to create multiple <code>from → to</code> pairs. But
this is Emacs, after all, which means that I can just write that
<code>query-replace-many</code> function I’ve always wanted!
<!--more-->
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p></p>
Originally, my motivation came through <a href="../../research.html">work</a>, where I <a href="../phd-workflow/2022-05-01-my-phd-workflow.html">write a lot of
LaTeX</a>. When polishing papers, it sometimes happens that I would like
to change or unify the notation of certain objects in the current
equation/environment/file.
<p></p>
When an alteration like this only encompasses a single action, like
switching <code>T</code> to <code>H</code>, a simple <code>query-replace</code> after narrowing to the
current region of interest is totally sufficient. For others, like
changing <code>T</code> to <code>H</code> <em>and</em> <code>S</code> to <code>G</code>, this solution, along with
multiple-cursors and other tools people usually go for, would already be
unsatisfactory—the whole region would need to be traversed twice. Now
imagine that you want to change <code>T</code> to <code>U</code> <em>and</em> <code>U</code> to <code>T</code>: chaos!
Save having to give some sort of temporary name to one of the objects,
which would be even slower, <code>query-replace</code> is quite useless in this
situation. It’s possible to cook up a manual solution using the
alternative <code>query-replace-regexp</code> function and capture groups, but I’m
unsure how many people know their elisp regular expressions well enough
for that to be time efficient. I don’t, and almost certainly never
will, so it seemed much easier to automate this instead!
<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>
<p></p>
Thankfully, since <code>replace.el</code> sports a decent API, writing a version of
<code>query-replace</code> that accepts multiple arguments turns out to be easy
enough. The high-level overview is this: we read in multiple queries
until an empty input is given,<!--
--><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This isn’t <em>quite</em> what’s actually done, but it’s the right mental
model to have (since this is how the function behaves). The gory
details are that we use the fact that <code>replace.el</code>’s default
suggestion is always the last query that was entered by the user.
What happens on an empty input is quite deep in the bowels of
<code>query-replace-read-from</code>. Since replacing these massive internal
functions sounds like a real pain, leaning on that functionality
suddenly appears much more reasonable. Thus, when we get back a
query that has already been entered in one way or another, we bail
out.</span></span>
 build up a regular expression of the
form <code>"\\(?:query-1\\|query-2\\|…\\)"</code>, and—when it comes to
replacing—test the current thing to be replaced against all of the
queries to select the correct one.
<p></p>
The beauty of this is that, since it’s really just a thin wrapper over
two functions from <code>replace.el</code> that do the heavy lifting, all of the
modules regular functionality, like the keybindings and history, just
work.
<p></p>
For example, in the following I replace <code>T</code> with <code>U</code> and, at the same
time, <code>U</code> with <code>T</code>. The first few matches are stepped through and the
rest is just accepted wholesale. At the bottom, you can see the default
<code>query-replace</code> interface when interacting with the query.
<p></p>
<img class="pure-img" src="./query-replace-many.gif">
<p></p>
The only cosmetic imperfection of this is that, while the replacement
candidate itself is correctly updated, we see the whole regular
expression <code>\(?U:\|T\)</code> as the thing to be replaced instead of the bit
that’s actually matching currently. However, since this would seem to
require some work and one of course sees what’s to be replaced by
looking at the thing at point, I can very much live with this for the
moment.
<h3 id="the-code">The code</h3>
<p></p>
Below is the full source code, in all of its hacky glory. Note that you
will need to <code>require</code> the <code>s.el</code> and <code>dash.el</code> libraries for this to
work, if you haven’t loaded these already (if you use any amount of
packages at all, chances are that you have).

<p></p>
In the post about my <a href="/posts/phd-workflow/2022-05-01-my-phd-workflow.html#citations">research workflow</a>, I briefly mentioned having to
call Emacs—or other external programs—from within <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad. I figured
that this was perhaps something that could be of use to more people than
just me. After a little bit of deliberation and coming up with a
generic enough API, I decided to turn it into an <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad module!
<p></p>
Yesterday these changes were merged into <a href="https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-contrib">xmonad-contrib</a>, and they are
now available for everyone to try out; provided one has the git version
of <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad <a href="https://xmonad.org/INSTALL.html">installed</a>.<!--
--><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">If you <em>really</em> want to try this feature but don’t want to bother
installing any unreleased—though stable—version, message me in any
way and maybe we’ll hurry up and cut 0.17.1 soon!</span></span>
<p></p>
I’d like to use this opportunity to both showcase the module—how and why
one would use it—and talk a little bit about its only redeeming
implementation detail.
<!--more-->
<h2 id="main-use-cases">Main use cases</h2>
<p></p>
Wouldn’t it be neat to have some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language"><span class="small-caps">edsl</span></a> for spawning external
processes? Something where one can just compose Haskell functions
together, not having to worry about the actual underlying string
manipulations? Something that’s composable, so that one does not have
to write the same <code>"emacsclient -c -a '' …"</code> or <code>"alacritty --working-directory …"</code> prefix over and over again? Well, at least
that’s what I thought on some rainy afternoon a few months ago.
<h3 id="scratchpads">Scratchpads</h3>
<p></p>
The first use case that I came up with was <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib/docs/XMonad-Util-NamedScratchpad.html">scratchpad</a>s. The idea of
these things is simple: while we normally don’t like floating windows,
it’s quite convenient to have some of them around that one can bring to
the current workspace, as well as hide, with a single keybinding. This
is useful for things like email, a calendar, a daily agenda, a
calculator, etc.
<p></p>
For scratchpads to work reliably, windows need to have some unique
characteristic they can be recognised by, like a special <a href="https://tronche.com/gui/x/icccm/sec-4.html#WM_CLASS">class or
instance name</a>. Endowing an application with additional properties
sounds exactly like what our <span class="small-caps">edsl</span> should be good at, so let’s try that!
<p></p>
Using the new features of <code>XMonad.Util.Run</code>, we could spawn an Emacs
frame with a special name for our scratchpad hooks to grab onto, and
execute <code>notmuch</code>:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">mailSession</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">::</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">X</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">String</span>
<span class="nf">mailSession</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">getInput</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">$</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="n">inEditor</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&gt;-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">setFrameName</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">mailInstName</span>
<span class="w">           </span><span class="o">&gt;-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">eval</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">function</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;notmuch&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p></p>
You can read the <code>&gt;-&gt;</code> operator a little like a pipe, where you start
with what you want and thread that information through to the end: “I
want an editor with a certain frame name that also starts up notmuch”.
<p></p>
In full, the above function would produce the string (broken into a few
lines for better readability)
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;emacsclient -c -a ''
             -F '(quote (name . \&quot;notmuch-scratch\&quot;))'
             --eval '(notmuch)'&quot;
</pre></div>

<p></p>
which would be quite bothersome to type indeed.
<p></p>
Because the type of <code>mailSession</code> is <code>X String</code> and not just <code>String</code>,
the setup for this is a little bit different than usual when using
scratchpads. You would use it like this:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">myScratchpads</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">::</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">X</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="kt">NamedScratchpad</span><span class="p">]</span>

</pre></div>

<p></p>
Normally you would also add your <code>myScratchpads</code> list to all calls of
<code>namedScratchpadAction</code>; e.g., when you define the keys to call your
scratchpads. However, since the former lives in <code>X</code> now, this doesn’t
work anymore! Thankfully,
<a href="https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-contrib/commit/3fc830aa09368dca04df24bf7ec4ac817f2de479">nowadays</a>
the first argument to <code>namedScratchpadAction</code> is actually unused and
only there for backwards compatibility. This means that it’s not
necessary to enter your scratchpads there at all if they are added to
your <code>manageHook</code>. For example, in the following I just provide the empty list:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;M-C-t&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">namedScratchpadAction</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">[]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;Mail&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p></p>
This works all the same with the above definition of <code>myScratchpads</code>.
<p></p>
A full example of how a scratchpad setup would look using this machinery
can be found in <a href="https://gitlab.com/slotThe/dotfiles/-/blob/master/xmonad/.config/xmonad/src/xmonad.hs#L414">my config</a>.
<h3 id="calling-emacs-in-scripts">Calling Emacs in scripts</h3>
<p></p>
Spawning frames is nice and all, but how about something more
complicated, like Emacs’s batch mode so that we can use it properly in
scripts? No problem at all!
<p></p>
For example, I have the following snippet in my config to get the
currently selected text and call <a href="https://github.com/slotthe/arxiv-citation">arxiv-citation</a> with it to <a href="/posts/phd-workflow/2022-05-01-my-phd-workflow.html#citations">produce a

</pre></div>

<p></p>
When executed, this translates to something like
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>emacs -L /home/slot/.config/emacs/elpa/dash-20220417.2250
      -L /home/slot/.config/emacs/elpa/s-20210616.619
      -L /home/slot/.config/emacs/elpa/arxiv-citation-20220510.1137/
      --batch
      --eval '(progn
                (require (quote arxiv-citation))
                (arXiv-citation &quot;&lt;url-in-the-primary-selection&gt;&quot;))'
</pre></div>

<p></p>
I certainly know which one I’d rather type—especially with <span class="small-caps">elpa</span>
directory names changing quite frequently! On that note,
<a href="https://github.com/slotthe/arxiv-citation">arxiv-citation</a> is on <span class="small-caps">melpa</span> now; yay!
<h3 id="other-programs">Other programs</h3>
<p></p>
As this is my main use case for it, the new features of
<code>XMonad.Util.Run</code> are quite specialised for Emacs. However, even for
other programs they may well come in handy. Drawing from the point
about scratchpads again, here is a hypothetical one that spawns a ghci
session:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">  </span><span class="n">ghci</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">proc</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">inTerm</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&gt;-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">setXClass</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">calcInstName</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&gt;-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">execute</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;ghci&quot;</span>
</pre></div>

<p></p>
Further, something that’s useful when dealing with <a href="/posts/phd-workflow/2022-05-01-my-phd-workflow.html#topics">topic-based
workspaces</a>
is spawning a terminal or an editor already in the current topic
directory:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kr">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">XMonad.Actions.TopicSpace</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="c1">-- for currentTopicDir and more</span>

<span class="c1">-- Optionally, modify the path to the editor with a function.</span>

<span class="nf">spawnEditorInTopic</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">with</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">=</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="n">proc</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">inEditor</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&gt;-$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">with</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;$&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">currentTopicDir</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">topicConfig</span>
</pre></div>

<p></p>
Quite convenient if you ask me.
<p></p>
If you have or know of a use case you would like to support but which is
awkward with the current set of functions and combinators do not
hesitate to open a pull request or an issue!
<h2 id="implementation-considerations">Implementation considerations</h2>
<p></p>
The implementation is actually very straightforward—no really, check out
the
<a href="https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-contrib/blob/master/XMonad/Util/Run.hs#L303">source</a>
if you don’t believe me!
<p></p>
One concept that’s still worth touching upon is the internal use of
<a href="https://github.com/spl/dlist#references">difference list</a>s. The basic idea of these things is that, instead of
concatenating strings one by one, we create functions <code>String -&gt; String</code>
and then use function composition to do the work for us:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">  </span><span class="c1">-- Ordinary string concatenation</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="s">&quot;string1&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;string2&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;string3&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;string4&quot;</span>

<span class="w">  </span><span class="c1">-- Using difference lists:</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="n">string1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">string2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">string3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">string4</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">::</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">String</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="n">string1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">s</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;string1&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">s</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="n">string2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">s</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">…</span>

<span class="w">  </span><span class="n">string1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">.</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">string2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">.</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">string3</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">.</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">string4</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span>
</pre></div>

<p></p>
Note how we have to apply the entire thing to <code>""</code> at the end in order
to actually get a string back. As a concrete example, assuming we have
set <code>"Emacs"</code> as our editor, the <code>inEditor</code> function would essentially
be
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">inEditor</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">::</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">String</span>
<span class="nf">inEditor</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">s</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot; Emacs &quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">s</span>
</pre></div>

<p></p>
There are some further considerations to be made, since we are in the
<code>X</code> monad and thus the type is actually <code>X (String -&gt; String)</code> instead
of just <code>String -&gt; String</code>, but that isn’t too important for us here.
<p></p>
Difference lists have some performance advantages over the traditional
concatenation of strings. The concatenation <code>(&lt;&gt;)</code> on strings is left
associative by default and so
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">    </span><span class="s">&quot;string1&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;string2&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;string3&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;string4&quot;</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="err">≡</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">((</span><span class="s">&quot;string1&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;string2&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;string3&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;string4&quot;</span>
</pre></div>

<p></p>
However, the complexity characteristics of this operation are working
against us here; the definition of <code>(&lt;&gt;)</code> on <code>String</code><!--
--><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Really, this is the definition of <code>(++)</code> for arbitrary lists <code>[a]</code>
and <code>(&lt;&gt;) = (++)</code> for <code>String = [Char]</code>, but let’s not get into
that here.</span></span>
 is
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">::</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">String</span>
<span class="kt">[]</span><span class="w">       </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">ys</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="w">           </span><span class="n">ys</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">ys</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">ys</span>
</pre></div>

<p></p>
We are merely traversing the first string, leaving the second one
completely untouched (and unevaluated!). All in all, this means that
<code>s₁ &lt;&gt; s₂</code> is in <code>𝓞(|s₁|)</code>; given an expression of the form
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">  </span><span class="p">((</span><span class="s">&quot;string1&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;string2&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;string3&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;string4&quot;</span>
</pre></div>

<p></p>
we will have to walk over <code>"string1"</code> three times! What we actually
want is a right-associative ordering—exactly what function compositions
gives us. Spelled out,

</pre></div>

<p></p>
which yields the desired behaviour. In fact, this is so canonical that
instead of using <code>(.)</code>, we could have also—perhaps a bit
confusingly—used <code>(&lt;&gt;)</code> directly:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">    </span><span class="n">string1</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="o">.</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">string2</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="o">.</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">string3</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="o">.</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">string4</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="err">≡</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">string1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">string2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">string3</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">string4</span>
</pre></div>

<p></p>
This is the fact that the <em>endomorphisms</em> for any type <code>a</code>—the functions
<code>a -&gt; a</code>—form a <em>monoid</em>. That is to say that they come equipped with
an associative an unital operation: function composition. In Haskell,
<code>(&lt;&gt;)</code> is, in some sense,
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/classes.html">overloaded</a> so that it
can be used with any monoidal composition one can think of!<!--
--><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Really, for any <em>semigroup</em>, which is a slightly weaker notion of
an operation that is merely associative, but doesn’t necessarily
have a unit.</span></span>
<p></p>
The attentive reader may have concluded that the pipe operator that we
called <code>(&gt;-&gt;)</code> above is really just <code>(&lt;&gt;)</code> in disguise, and that’s
exactly right! I, however, thought that for people not familiar with
Haskell, giving it a pipe-like appearance would be more conceptually
amenable to the threading idea.
<p></p>
I haven’t benchmarked this, so it’s not entirely clear to me whether
performance is actually relevant in this situation,<!--
--><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I suspect that the answer is “probably not”—that didn’t stop me,
however!</span></span>
 but using
difference lists just feels right here, and so I did.
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p></p>
I have to say that I’m quite satisfied with this API. In fact, if I
look at the old code that only resided within my personal config, it’s
even a bit more ergonomic in a few places, despite having essentially no
user-specific strings hardcoded anywhere! As I said before, if you try
this and find something missing, do let me know and we’ll probably find
a solution! If you try this and find it useful, also let me know :)
<p></p>
Of course, technically none of this needs to live only inside your
<span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad config at all. In combination with the excellent <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/turtle">turtle</a>
library, I reckon it would be quite easy to produce Haskell versions of
cool tools like magit.sh.<!--
--><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Available <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/magit.sh">here</a>. I also
maintain a slightly modified and POSIX shell compatible version
<a href="https://gitlab.com/slotThe/dotfiles/-/blob/master/scripts/.scripts/magit.sh">here</a>.</span></span>
 Go nuts!

<p></p>
After reading <a href="https://castel.dev/post/research-workflow/">Gilles Castel</a>’s excellent blog post about his research
workflow, I decided that it was as good a time as any to write about
mine—deeming it novel enough to hopefully contribute something to the
discussion.
<p></p>
Just like Castel, I’m a new PhD student in mathematics, which means no
lab work and—in my case—no code. Just you and your inability to
understand basic concepts. As such, I often scribble things down on
paper or a blackboard first and, when sufficiently convinced that the
information is worth keeping around, type it up. Typesetting something
is a surprisingly effective way to catch errors in handwritten
manuscripts!
<p></p>
As basically my entire digital life happens in either <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> or
<a href="https://xmonad.org/"><span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad</a>, my setup is heavily skewed in that direction; I will make use
of these tools almost every step of the way.
<!--more-->
As such, there is a lot of tangential almost relevant bits that I could
cover here. However, since these aren’t directly related to my
<em>research</em> workflow—and there is a lot of great resources out there
already—I decided to not do this here.<!--
--><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">If you’d like some examples: being employed at a university also
means I have to worry a bit about efficiently dealing with
bureaucracy (<a href="https://notmuchmail.org/">notmuch.el</a>), keeping some sort of up-to-date
calendar and readable todo-notes (<a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> and goodies, as well
as integration via <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib/docs/XMonad-Prompt-OrgMode.html"><span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad’s OrgMode prompt</a>), accessing the
universities internal nextcloud server (<a href="https://gitlab.com/hperrey/khalel">khalel</a> and <code>davfs2</code> or
<code>TRAMP</code>), … You get the idea.</span></span>
<h2 id="high-level-structure">High level structure</h2>
<h3 id="topics">Topics</h3>
<p></p>
<span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad has a module called <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib/docs/XMonad-Actions-TopicSpace.html">TopicSpace</a>, which upgrades the X11
workspace—virtual desktop—concept to so-called topics. These are
workspaces with a “theme” associated to them; for example, I have a
topic for every project that I’m currently working on. This results in
a clean separation of concerns. Plus, I always know where my windows
are!
<p></p>
Every topic has a directory and a “startup hook”, firing when the topic
is switched to and empty, associated to it. While most convenient for
programming related tasks—e.g., spawn <code>ghcid</code> in the relevant directory
or automatically build and open this website—it’s also quite convenient
for mathematical projects.
<p></p>
I have set up special keybindings to bring up an Emacs session in the
topic directory, or spawn a terminal there. Switching to topics is done
fuzzily via the <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad prompt, which means I only have to type a few
characters to get to my destination. This makes it feasible to have 30
topics, instead of the usual 9 or so, in the first place. As a result,
it’s rather fast to go from thinking about a certain problem to working
on it. When I’m already inside a project, I leverage Emacs’s built-in
<code>project.el</code> library to search through files and the like.
<p></p>
<img class="pure-img" src="./topics.gif">
<h3 id="files">Files</h3>
<p></p>
Here I keep things relatively simple; I have a big “library” directory
in which essentially all books or papers that I’ve ever read reside.
This may sound a bit chaotic, but since I never interact with this
as-a-directory it is actually the easiest and cleanest solution for me.
<p></p>
To keep a bit of order, all files are named in a consistent and
descriptive way: <code>authors_title.pdf</code>, where <code>authors</code> is a list of last
names of all authors separated by hyphens and <code>title</code> is the title of
the work, also separated by hyphens. For example:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    pastro-street_double-of-a-monoidal-category.pdf
</pre></div>

<p></p>
Also in this directory are <code>.xopp</code> files, when I scribble on the
relevant <span class="small-caps">pdf</span>s in <a href="https://xournalpp.github.io/">xournalpp</a>; more on that later.
<p></p>
Instead of navigating to it, all interaction with the library is done
via <a href="https://github.com/slotthe/hmenu">hmenu</a>, a small wrapper around <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">dmenu</a> to facilitate this kind of
behaviour. I merely have to press <code>M-y</code><!--
--><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I will be using Emacs style notation throughout the article. This
means that, for example, <code>C-x a</code> should be read as “hold down
control and press x, then release both and press a”. You can of
course safely ignore this, since the keys just serve illustrative
purposes. An important note for Emacs users, lest anyone be
confused: in <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad, <code>M-</code> usually does <strong>not</strong> refer to the Meta
key, but to the <code>modMask</code> that the user specified. This is indeed
<code>&lt;Alt&gt;</code> by default, but many people understandably rebind this
straight away to something that’s less likely to interfere with
other programs. In my case, that’s the Super key, so <code>M-s</code> means
<code>&lt;Super&gt;-s</code> and not <code>&lt;Alt&gt;-s</code>.</span></span>
 and can then fuzzy search
through the directory. Once I’ve made a choice, <span class="small-caps">pdf</span>s are automatically
opened in <a href="https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/">zathura</a> and <code>.xopp</code> files are opened in xournalpp.
<p></p>
<img class="pure-img" src="./hmenu.gif">
<p></p>
My bibliography is organised in a similar spirit; see
<a href="#citations">Citations</a>.
<h2 id="note-taking">Note taking</h2>
<h3 id="handwritten-notes">Handwritten notes</h3>
<p></p>
For handwritten notes I… use real paper! A little elaboration is
probably in order, having talked about <code>.xopp</code> files and xournalpp
above. I do have a Wacom tablet lying around and I’m quite happy
annotating <span class="small-caps">pdf</span>s with it. In lieu of printing everything out, this
alleviates a little bit of the usual pain with reading papers, like
coming back to one three weeks later and getting stuck on the same
calculation as last time. I do love those annotations!
<p></p>
However, there is just something deeply psychologically pleasing about
ordinary pen and paper—nothing beats drawing up the first version of
many ideas there. It’s a very “pure” experience: there’s no noise or
distractions, nothing that could break, no additional layer of
abstraction between you and the maths. Chalkboards—but not whiteboards,
with their ever empty markers—fall into this category as well,
especially when collaborating with others.
<p></p>
Not without my quirks (as I’m sure you’ve noticed), I’m a bit picky
about the particular writing setup. It’s either completely white A5<!--
--><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Although, admittedly, when drawing up large diagrams I’m sometimes
forced to switch to A4 paper in landscape mode.</span></span>

paper, paired with a good (mechanical) pencil/a fine pen, or thick
dotted paper, paired with a fountain pen.
<p></p>
Quite enjoying the experience, I tend to write quite a lot of
manuscripts by hand first. Of course, anything that’s supposed to be
permanent should be typed up properly!
<h3 id="digital-notes">Digital notes</h3>
<p></p>
Not wanting to go insane, I use LaTeX for all of my digital note taking.
My writing setup for <code>.tex</code> files is pretty similar to <a href="https://karthinks.com/software/latex-input-for-impatient-scholars/">Karthik
Chikmagalur</a>’s—whose excellent post you should definitely check out—so I
will not belabour the point too much here. The tl;dr is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/">AUCTeX</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/cdominik/cdlatex">CDLaTeX</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ymarco/auto-activating-snippets">aas</a>.
<p></p>
<img class="pure-img" src="./input.gif">
<p></p>
In case you’re not used to <code>prettify-symbols-mode</code>: the inserted LaTeX
code was
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">\begin</span><span class="nb">{</span>definition<span class="nb">}</span> <span class="k">\label</span><span class="nb">{</span>def:day-convolution<span class="nb">}</span>
  The <span class="k">\emph</span><span class="nb">{</span>Day convolution<span class="nb">}</span> of two functors <span class="s">$</span><span class="nb">F</span><span class="s">$</span> and <span class="s">$</span><span class="nb">G</span><span class="s">$</span> is
  <span class="sb">\[</span>
<span class="nb">    F </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nb"> G </span><span class="nv">\defeq</span>
<span class="nb">      </span><span class="nv">\int</span><span class="nb">^{C,D </span><span class="nv">\in</span><span class="nb"> </span><span class="nv">\cc</span><span class="nb">} </span><span class="nv">\cc</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nb">C </span><span class="nv">\otimes</span><span class="nb"> D, </span><span class="nv">\blank</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="nb"> </span><span class="nv">\otimes</span><span class="nb"> FC </span><span class="nv">\otimes</span><span class="nb"> GD.</span>
<span class="nb">  </span><span class="s">\]</span>
<span class="k">\end</span><span class="nb">{</span>definition<span class="nb">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p></p>
I do use some smaller packages not mentioned in Chikmagalur’s article,
like <a href="https://github.com/oantolin/math-delimiters">math-delimiters</a> and <a href="https://github.com/slotthe/change-env">latex-change-env</a>. The former is for
quickly changing between inline and display math, complete with slurping
punctuation symbols into display math and barfing them out of inline
math. For example, “<code>$1 + 1$.</code>” becomes “<code>\[1 + 1.\]</code>” (with line
breaks) and back.
<p></p>
The <code>latex-change-env</code> package is for changing between different kinds
of environments, including display math, while offering to rename labels
across the project if necessary. When deleting a label from an
environment, it also remembers this for the session!<!--
--><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This is based on the hash of the contents of the environment—if
that changes, the label is “lost”; though it can of course still
be retrieved manually from the relevant hash map.</span></span>
<p></p>
<img class="pure-img" src="./label-renaming.gif">
<p></p>
One neat feature of AUCTeX that I find myself using more and more often
lately<!--
--><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This is, in part, due to the new <code>pixel-scroll-precision-mode</code> in
Emacs 29, making use of XInput 2.4 functionality. It makes
scrolling through buffers that are quite dense with pictures
rather smooth.</span></span>
 is the in-buffer preview. Usually when writing a draft I’m
not that interested in how exactly something looks in the <span class="small-caps">pdf</span>—that part
comes later, believe me. In cases like these, just calling
<code>preview-buffer</code> is quite convenient and lets me use the screen real
estate that a <span class="small-caps">pdf</span> viewer would have taken up for something else.
<p></p>
<img class="pure-img" src="./preview.gif">
<p></p>
I always use pure LaTeX for writing papers, drafts, or presentations.
However, I also take lots of notes in <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a>, which, as a crude
first approximation, is something like a markup language that’s <em>very</em>
well integrated into Emacs.
<p></p>
For the actual note-taking, I use the venerable <a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">org-roam</a>—a free
software alternative to the proprietary Roam Research program—to jot
down things that I’d like to remember for more than three days.
Org-roam describes itself as a “plain-text personal knowledge management
system”, which fits the bill pretty well. In short, it’s a note taking
system in the spirit of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a> method, which is essentially
about having lots of notes with lots of backlinks to related concepts:
<p></p>
<img class="pure-img" src="./backlinks.png">
<p></p>
In fact, using <a href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui">org-roam-ui</a>, one can even visualise the entire
Zettelkasten as an interactive and pretty graph in which notes become
nodes and backlinks become edges!
<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<img class="pure-img" src="./org-roam-ui-close.png">
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<img class="pure-img" src="./org-roam-ui-far.png">
</div>
</div>
<p></p>
Org-roam <a href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam#configuration">suggests
keybindings</a> for all
of the most important concepts: creating notes, inserting them, showing
all of the backlinks of a file, etc. An important extra that I’ve added
is having two “types” of notes: <code>reference</code>s, where things that I
learned but are otherwise known reside, and <code>novel</code>s, where I put my own
ideas.
<p></p>
As I’m predisposed to quite easily forget details, I regularly engage
with my Zettelkasten, so as to keep things fresh in my mind. Reading
through all of the notes that are relevant to what I’m currently working
on, creating new backlinks, filling in gaps, even deleting old
information and re-organising some local region of the graph. Indeed, I
tag every new entry as a <code>draft</code> until further notice, forcing me to go
back there especially. This results in pretty good recollection of the
most important facts, even with my brain.
<h2 id="staying-up-to-date">Staying up to date</h2>
<p></p>
I use <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed">elfeed</a> to query the <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> for new preprints that are of
interest to me. Thankfully, the fields I’m subscribed to tend to be
moving slow-ish and so I can manage to at least read the abstract of
every paper that pops up in my feed. There is also <a href="https://gitlab.com/slotThe/dotfiles/-/blob/afa8fd39cea2647152038e3f4dd42f1dbd66c413/emacs/.config/emacs/lisp/rss.el#L61">a little bit of
elisp</a>
involved to print arXiv entries in a more readable way than the default
formatting.
<p></p>
When the abstract interests me, I usually directly download the paper
into my library and open it with zathura. This is fully automated via
<a href="https://github.com/slotthe/arxiv-citation">arxiv-citation</a>—more on that later. I merely have to press <code>C-c d</code>
while looking at a paper and magic happens!
<p></p>
<img class="pure-img" src="./elfeed.gif">
<p></p>
In the above gif, on the right-hand side you can see a score associated
to each entry. While reading every abstract has worked quite well for
me thus far, it’s nice to get the papers that are “probably interesting”
high up, so that I’m more likely to notice them sooner rather than
later. I use <a href="https://github.com/sp1ff/elfeed-score">elfeed-score</a> for this, which integrates seamlessly into
the rest of the machinery. It compares certain features of the entry
(like the title and abstract) with a list of regular expressions,
increasing the total score of the entry every time it matches something.
<p></p>
Speaking of the arXiv, in <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad I have bound <code>M-s a</code> to look up the
given string there. Likewise, <a href="https://zbmath.org/">zbmath</a> is searched with <code>M-s z</code>. When
these commands get a “universal argument”—an Emacs concept that <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad
borrowed—they automatically start a search with the current selection
instead. Briefly, pressing <code>M-u</code> before a command can modify it in
different ways. All of my search commands act on the <a href="https://www.jwz.org/doc/x-cut-and-paste.html">primary
selection</a> when given such an argument; <code>M-u M-s &lt;letter&gt;</code> will look up
the currently selected text on the relevant “search engine”. One
instance where this is useful is for quickly switching between the arXiv
and zbmath:
<p></p>
<img class="pure-img" src="./selected-search.gif">
<h3 id="citations">Citations</h3>
<p></p>
For citation management, I use a very simple system—no Zotero, JabRef,
or similar technology. Concretely, this means that I have a blessed
bibliography file somewhere within my home directory and I either
symlink (when I’m writing something alone) or copy (when working with at
least one coauthor) the file into the relevant project directory. In
case of a copy operation, I only have to update a single variable in
Emacs (<code>arxiv-citation-bibtex-files</code>), which is good enough for me and
doesn’t seem to warrant a slightly more automated, yet probably much
more complicated solution.
<p></p>
Adding new citations is done via the now aptly named Emacs package
<a href="https://github.com/slotthe/arxiv-citation">arxiv-citation</a><!--
--><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Ostensibly, this should be an <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad module, as it does not
necessarily have anything to do with Emacs itself. However, I had
already written the elfeed integration and so the most annoying
part (scraping the arXiv xml for certain bits) was already done.
On the other hand, there are more Emacs than <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad users, so
perhaps doing it like this will help more people anyways.</span></span>
 with <a href="https://gitlab.com/slotThe/dotfiles/-/blob/afa8fd39cea2647152038e3f4dd42f1dbd66c413/xmonad/.config/xmonad/src/xmonad.hs#L576">a bit of
plumbing</a>
on the <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad side to get Emacs going. The basic idea is that—given an
arXiv or zbmath link—we first look up the paper on zbmath to see if it
was published and, if not, just use the arXiv data to construct our own
bibliography entry instead. By default, my keybinding for this acts on
the primary selection, so I merely have to highlight the link, press
<code>M-o a</code>, sit back, and enjoy the show. The following gif should help
drive home the point, also showcasing the format of a not yet published
paper and a published one.
<p></p>

<p></p>
And that’s it! If nothing else, this post helped me to nail down some
ideas that I had lying around and got me to finally clean up and publish
many of the extensions talked about here—that’s already a win in my
book.
<p></p>
I’m sure that some details will change over the course of the next three
years as I mature mathematically and my needs change, but overall I feel
pretty comfortable with this setup.
<h5 id="addendum">Addendum</h5>
<p></p>
Thanks to everyone who reached out! I received some inquiries as to my
