  Welcome to this small corner of the internet that I've claimed for
  myself—enjoy your stay.

    </div>
    <p>
      I’ve just released version 0.3 of <code>latex-change-env</code>, featuring some
major improvements with regard to inline maths and macro handling; this
seems as good a time as any to talk about the package in full. I
briefly mentioned it in the post about my <a href="./my-phd-workflow.html#digital-notes">research workflow</a>, but I
figure now that the library has reached a state where I’m not ashamed of
it anymore—at least, not at the time of writing this—it may warrant its
own post.

    </div>
    <p>
      I’ve become quite enamoured with sidenotes recently, and so of course
this website now has them as well! Thankfully, the integration with
pandoc and Hakyll is quite straightforward, because other people have
already done the hard work. Depending on your use-case, however, the
existing libraries might not entirely fit the bill; for example, by
default blocks that are more complicated than just paragraphs of pure
text don’t work. In this post, I’d like to explain an alternative
approach of integrating sidenotes into pandoc, which does enable the use
of these features.

    </div>
    <p>
      By default, Hakyll uses pandoc to generate syntax highlighting for all
kinds of different programming languages. However, even in simple
examples the <span class="small-caps">html</span> this produces is unsatisfactory. Thankfully, the two
programs are almost infinitely customisable, and changing pretty much
any setting doesn’t usually involve a lot of work—this is no exception.
Using <code>pygmentize</code> as an example, I will show you how you can swap out
pandoc’s native syntax highlighting with pretty much any third party
tool that can output <span class="small-caps">html</span>.

and ideas into an Org file. The functionality that the module provides
has proven to be extremely useful to me, and really I couldn’t be
happier with it. However, a user recently contacted me by email and
told me that they’re missing but one feature: the ability to immediately
refile notes.

      I have a new preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03545">on the arXiv</a>! It is joint work with
Sebastian Halbig, and concerns itself with the interplay of different
structures on monoidal categories that give rise to a notion of
“duality”. At five pages, it is a very short paper; yet I’d still like
to give a little teaser as to what kind of question we sought to answer.

      I’d like to announce a small package I’ve written: <a href="https://github.com/slotThe/vc-use-package">vc-use-package</a>. It
is a first attempt at integrating the new (as of Emacs 29)
<code>package-vc.el</code> with the now built-in use-package. I’ve already talked
about how these two interact in my <a href="https://tony-zorman.com/posts/2022-11-30-package-vc-install.html">last post</a>—you can
see this package as automating things juuuust a little more.

      The Emacs 29 release branch was just cut—and it’s chock full of new
features! In this post, I want to talk about the new
<code>package-vc-install</code> function, which allows one to install packages
directly from their respective upstream source; for example, GitHub. It
can be seen as a built-in alternative to things like quelpa or
straight.el.

      Here’s a fun one: when previewing LaTeX fragments via AUCTeX’s

monitors are set up in portrait mode.

      Emacs is the “extensible text editor”, and it wouldn’t be fun if one
didn’t at least try to take advantage of that, right? Having just
written a <a href="https://gitlab.com/slotThe/dotfiles/-/tree/master/emacs/.config/emacs">README</a> for my Emacs configuration, I
thought it might be nice to somewhat expand on certain ideas and give a
little context to some snippets that have accumulated over time.

While there is a post about <a href="https://tony-zorman.com/posts/query-replace/2022-08-06-query-replace-many.html">my version</a> of the
<code>query-replace</code> function, most other tidbits have only seen the light of
day in places like the “Weekly Tips, Tricks, &c.” thread on Reddit. In
the spirit of hosting my content somewhere that I actually control,<!--

      If you’ve been doing category theory for any amount of time, you’ll
probably have stumbled upon enriched category theory as a way of
expressing categorical ideas internal to some context other than
<strong>Set</strong>. Reading into it, you might have come across these foreign
sounding concepts like weighted (co)limits and wondered what that was
all about—and then got lost for a few days, trying to decipher what
<a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/10/tr10abs.html">Kelly</a> is talking about and why symbols resembling tensor
products are suddenly being thrown around. At least that’s what
happened to me.
<p></p>
After scouring the internet for good resources, I found two really
enlightening blog posts: one by <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/02/day_on_rcfts.html#c007723">Todd Trimble</a> and the
other by <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/02/day_on_rcfts.html#c007688">John Baez</a>—and they’re too good not to share.
Plus, people always say that you don’t understand a concept unless you
can explain it to someone else, so here’s my shot at it!

      One of my favourite—and most used—modules is <code>XMonad.​Actions.​TopicSpace</code>.
However, it seems relatively unknown among the general <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad community.
I fear this is due to the fact that the module is quite old and formerly
had a rather high barrier to entry. Despite having been given shiny
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib/docs/XMonad-Actions-TopicSpace.html">new documentation</a>, lots of people probably did not bother
revisiting it and thus still don’t really understand why they might be
interested in using topics instead of workspaces. Time to change that!

much like <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">dmenu</a>—it is designed to rapidly capture thoughts and ideas
whenever inspiration strikes and, importantly, to do so without
disrupting one’s current workflow. The module recently got support for
Org <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Priorities.html">priorities</a>, so I figured this was as good an excuse as
any to talk about it.

      As its name suggests, Emacs’s <code>query-replace</code> function, bound to <code>M-%</code> by default, can be used to replace occurences of one string with another—and it’s quite good at what it does.
However, there is one crucial feature missing from its default functionality: the ability to create multiple <code>from → to</code> pairs.
But this is Emacs, after all, which means that I can just write that <code>query-replace-many</code> function I’ve always wanted!

      In the post about my <a href="./posts/phd-workflow/2022-05-01-my-phd-workflow.html#citations">research workflow</a>, I briefly mentioned having to
call Emacs—or other external programs—from within <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad. I figured
that this was perhaps something that could be of use to more people than
just me. After a little bit of deliberation and coming up with a
generic enough <span class="small-caps">api</span>, I decided to turn it into an <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad module!
<p></p>
Yesterday these changes were merged into <a href="https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-contrib">xmonad-contrib</a>, and they are

I’d like to use this opportunity to both showcase the module—how and why
one would use it—and talk a little bit about its only redeeming

      After reading <a href="https://castel.dev/post/research-workflow/">Gilles Castel</a>’s excellent blog post about his research
workflow, I decided that it was as good a time as any to write about
mine—deeming it novel enough to hopefully contribute something to the
discussion.
<p></p>
Just like Castel, I’m a new PhD student in mathematics, which means no
lab work and—in my case—no code. Just you and your inability to
understand basic concepts. As such, I often scribble things down on
paper or a blackboard first and, when sufficiently convinced that the
information is worth keeping around, type it up. Typesetting something
is a surprisingly effective way to catch errors in handwritten
manuscripts!
<p></p>
As basically my entire digital life happens in either <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> or
<a href="https://xmonad.org/"><span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad</a>, my setup is heavily skewed in that direction; I will make use
of these tools almost every step of the way.
