  enjoy your stay.

    <h2>How to query-replace multiple matches!</h2>

    
<p>As its name suggests, Emacs’s <code>query-replace</code> function (bound to <code>M-%</code>
by default) can be used to replace occurences of one string with
another. In comparison to other tools that are used for similar
purposes—(a subset of) keyboard macros and multiple-cursors—the whole
process after entering the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> strings is interactive all
the way through: it’s very fast to step through the individual matches
and decide on the spot whether one would like to replace them or not.
Needless to say, I like <code>query-replace</code> a lot! In true Emacs fashion,
the function also takes way too many arguments: among other things, it
can operate on the current region, backwards, or only on things
surrounded by words boundaries.</p>
<p>However, there is one crucial feature missing from its default
functionality: the ability to create multiple <code>from → to</code> pairs. But
this is Emacs, after all, which means that I can just write that
<code>query-replace-many</code> function I’ve always wanted!</p>

    <h2>Calling Emacs from XMonad</h2>

    
<p>In the post about my <a href="./posts/phd-workflow/2022-05-01-my-phd-workflow.html#citations">research workflow</a>, I briefly mentioned having to
call Emacs—or other external programs—from within XMonad. I figured
that this was perhaps something that could be of use to more people than
just me. After a little bit of deliberation and coming up with a
generic enough API, I decided to turn it into an XMonad module!</p>
<p>Yesterday these changes were merged into the <a href="https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-contrib">xmonad-contrib</a> repository
and they are now available for everyone to try out; provided one has the
git version of XMonad <a href="https://xmonad.org/INSTALL.html">installed</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I’d like to use this opportunity to both showcase the module—how and why
one would use it—and talk a little bit about its only redeeming
implementation detail.</p>

    <h2>My PhD Research Workflow</h2>

    
<p>After reading <a href="https://castel.dev/post/research-workflow/">Gilles Castel</a>’s excellent blog post about his research
workflow, I decided that it was as good a time as any to write about
mine—deeming it novel enough to hopefully contribute something to the
discussion.</p>
<p>Just like Castel, I’m a new PhD student in mathematics, which means no
lab work and—in my case—no code. Just you and your inability to
understand basic concepts. As such, I often scribble things down on
paper or a blackboard first and, when sufficiently convinced that the
information is worth keeping around, type it up. Typesetting something
is a surprisingly effective way to catch errors in handwritten
manuscripts!</p>
<p>As basically my entire digital life happens in either <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> or
<a href="https://xmonad.org/">XMonad</a>, my setup is very heavily skewed in that direction; I will make
use of these tools almost every step of the way.
