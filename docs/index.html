    <h2>A Potpourri of Emacs Tweaks</h2>

    
<p>Emacs is the “extensible text editor”, and it wouldn’t be fun if one
didn’t at least try to take advantage of that, right? Having just
written a <a href="https://gitlab.com/slotThe/dotfiles/-/tree/master/emacs/.config/emacs">README</a> for my Emacs configuration, I
thought it might be nice to somewhat expand on certain ideas and give a
little context to some snippets that have accumulated over time.</p>
<p>While there is a post about <a href="https://tony-zorman.com/posts/query-replace/2022-08-06-query-replace-many.html">my version</a> of the
<code>query-replace</code> function, most other tidbits have only seen the light of
day in places like the “Weekly Tips, Tricks, &amp;c.” thread on Reddit. In
the spirit of hosting my content somewhere that I actually control,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
I chose to showcase these again here, hoping that other people may also
find some of this stuff useful.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Weighted Colimits as Tensor Products of Modules</h2>

    
<p>If you’ve been doing category theory for any amount of time, you’ll
probably have stumbled upon enriched category theory as a way of
expressing categorical ideas internal to some context other than
<strong>Set</strong>. Reading into it, you might have come across these foreign
sounding concepts like weighted (co)limits and wondered what that was
all about—and then got lost for a few days, trying to decipher what
<a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/10/tr10abs.html">Kelly</a> is talking about and why symbols resembling tensor
products are suddenly being thrown around. At least that’s what
happened to me.</p>
<p>After scouring the internet for good resources, I found two really
enlightening blog posts: one by <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/02/day_on_rcfts.html#c007723">Todd Trimble</a> and the
other by <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/02/day_on_rcfts.html#c007688">John Baez</a>—and they’re too good not to share.
Plus, people always say that you don’t understand a concept unless you
can explain it to someone else, so here’s my shot at it!</p>

    <h2>XMonad Module Showcase: X.A.TopicSpace</h2>

    
<p>One of my favourite—and most used—modules is XMonad.Actions.TopicSpace.
However, it seems relatively unknown among the general XMonad community.
I fear this is due to the fact that the module is quite old and formerly
had a rather high barrier to entry. Despite having been given shiny
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib/docs/XMonad-Actions-TopicSpace.html">new documentation</a>, lots of people probably did not bother
revisiting it and thus still don’t really understand why they might be
interested in using topics instead of workspaces. Time to change that!</p>

    <h2>Rapidly Capture Ideas with XMonad and Emacs</h2>

    <p>As I’ve said before, basically my entire digital life happens in either
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> or <a href="https://xmonad.org/">XMonad</a>. Thus, a lot of time spent on my setup either goes
towards working on the two configurations separately, or—as we’ll do
today—bringing them ever closed together.</p>
<p>Specifically, I want to showcase a new<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> XMonad module:
<a href="https://xmonad.github.io/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Prompt-OrgMode.html">XMonad.Prompt.OrgMode</a>. Building on top of XMonad’s prompt—which works
much like <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">dmenu</a>—it is designed to rapidly capture thoughts and ideas
whenever inspiration strikes and, importantly, to do so without
disrupting one’s current workflow. The module recently got support for
Org <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Priorities.html">priorities</a>, so I figured this was as good an excuse as
any to talk about it.</p>

    <h2>How to query-replace multiple matches!</h2>

    
<p>As its name suggests, Emacs’s <code>query-replace</code> function (bound to <code>M-%</code>
by default) can be used to replace occurences of one string with
another. In comparison to other tools that are used for similar
purposes—(a subset of) keyboard macros and multiple-cursors—the whole
process after entering the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> strings is interactive all
the way through: it’s very fast to step through the individual matches
and decide on the spot whether one would like to replace them or not.
Needless to say, I like <code>query-replace</code> a lot! In true Emacs fashion,
the function also takes way too many arguments: among other things, it
can operate on the current region, backwards, or only on things
surrounded by words boundaries.</p>
<p>However, there is one crucial feature missing from its default
functionality: the ability to create multiple <code>from → to</code> pairs. But
this is Emacs, after all, which means that I can just write that
<code>query-replace-many</code> function I’ve always wanted!</p>

    <h2>Calling Emacs from XMonad</h2>

    
<p>In the post about my <a href="./posts/phd-workflow/2022-05-01-my-phd-workflow.html#citations">research workflow</a>, I briefly mentioned having to
call Emacs—or other external programs—from within XMonad. I figured
that this was perhaps something that could be of use to more people than
just me. After a little bit of deliberation and coming up with a
generic enough API, I decided to turn it into an XMonad module!</p>
<p>Yesterday these changes were merged into the <a href="https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-contrib">xmonad-contrib</a> repository
and they are now available for everyone to try out; provided one has the
git version of XMonad <a href="https://xmonad.org/INSTALL.html">installed</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I’d like to use this opportunity to both showcase the module—how and why
one would use it—and talk a little bit about its only redeeming
implementation detail.</p>

    <h2>My PhD Research Workflow</h2>

    
<p>After reading <a href="https://castel.dev/post/research-workflow/">Gilles Castel</a>’s excellent blog post about his research
workflow, I decided that it was as good a time as any to write about
mine—deeming it novel enough to hopefully contribute something to the
discussion.</p>
<p>Just like Castel, I’m a new PhD student in mathematics, which means no
lab work and—in my case—no code. Just you and your inability to
understand basic concepts. As such, I often scribble things down on
paper or a blackboard first and, when sufficiently convinced that the
information is worth keeping around, type it up. Typesetting something
is a surprisingly effective way to catch errors in handwritten
manuscripts!</p>
<p>As basically my entire digital life happens in either <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> or
<a href="https://xmonad.org/">XMonad</a>, my setup is very heavily skewed in that direction; I will make
use of these tools almost every step of the way.
